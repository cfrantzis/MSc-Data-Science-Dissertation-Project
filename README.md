### Project Report for MSc in Data Science by Christos Frantzis


The code is uploaded as five Jupyter Notebooks sorted by name.


For the purpose of recreating or running the project on your own computer, the filepaths for loading the required dataset, saving the final dataset and saving the plotted graphs need to be changed accordingly and the notebooks order needs to be respected. Filepaths exist in all notebooks except the *1. Web_Scraping.ipynb*.


There are two files inside the folder Dataset but you will only need the *df_full_premierleague.csv* to run the project. A *final_premier_league_dataset.csv* will be initiated on your computer when you run the *2. Data_Expolration_&_Feature_Engineering.ipynb* file.
